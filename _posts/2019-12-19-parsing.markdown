Today I started the development of the step that permit transform **iCalendar** file into a tweet which will be send

I start to read the **iCalendar** file and put it as a **string**, that I parse to have all the data into a **map**.
After, I choose the data we need to do tweets and I put them in a **string**.

For now, I done the parsing of the **iCalendar** file, and I'm working on the data.
