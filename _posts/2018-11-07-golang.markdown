**Golang** is a programming language created by **Google** used in a lot of projects, like **Docker, Kubernetes, Uber, â€¦**

This language seems to be a really complete programming language that allows us to do a lot of things, to make syntax clear and concise, and make complex calculations.

Also, **Golang** is usable for programming the **Twitter Bot** we want to do thanks to a lot of libraries.

### Exemples :
Here there are two way to initialize variables, they are equivalent but the second is shorter.

```go
var i int = 0
j := 0
```

This is the way to initialize functions in **Golang**.
The first key word is *func* followed by the name of the function, here *test*.
The first brackets are the passing arguments and their type, and the second are the type of the return arguments.
With **Golang**, you can return more than one arguments.

```go
func test(x, y string) (string, string) {
    return y, x
}
```
