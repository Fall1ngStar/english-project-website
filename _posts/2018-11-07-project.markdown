We are going to program a **Twitter bot** named **Planning Twitter Bot** that is sending :
 - The next lesson **every hour**, 15 minutes before
 - A daily planning **every evening**
 - A weekly planning **every sunday**

We will use the [Golang](https://english-project.tgarcin.fr/golang/discovery/2018/11/07/golang.html) to program it, and it will be host on AWS.

If this project is too easy to realize, a good next step is to add a graphical planning generation (an image) that is send every week.
