Today I started the development of the step that allows us to transform the **iCalendar** file into a tweet which will be send

I have started to read the **iCalendar** file and puted it as a **string**, that I have parsed to put all the data into a **map**.
After, I will choose the data we need to do tweets and I will put them in a **string**.

For now, I have done the parsing of the **iCalendar** file, and I will work on the data.
